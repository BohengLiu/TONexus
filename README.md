## Introduction
---

TONexus is a project that aims to build a wallet social map to visualize how the wallet interact with others. and also show the transaction details to the user;

It will represent the `wallet` as a node in the graph, and the transaction as the edge between the nodes. The node will be colored by the type of the wallet, and the edge will be colored by the type of the transaction. The transaction could be a `payment`, `transfer`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `exchange`, `airdrop`, `staking`, `reward`, `refund`, `burn`, `mint`, `other` and so on.
We could also switch the view in Graph or Flow which could help you understand how the wallets(People) iteract with each others in TON Network(Sociaty)
